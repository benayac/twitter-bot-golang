# twitter-bot-golang

I am editing the README file. Adding some more details about the project description.

A project for me to learn how to use twitter activity API and golang 

To make your own bot, clone this repo and add config.json to config folder 

```
{
    "token": {
        "consumer_secret_key": YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET,
        "consumer_api_key": YOUR_CONSUMER_API,
        "access_token_key": YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
        "access_token_secret_key": YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
    }
}
```

Then host this app or use local tunnel such as ngrok to make the webhook subcribe request to twitter server.
